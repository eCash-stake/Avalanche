Staking Rewards 17.90%
At this milestone, the avalanche network requires that miners allocate a portion of the block subsidy to stakers as an incentive for securing the network. Each peer in the avalanche network deterministically calculates the next staker to receive a reward based on the previous block hash, the Proof ID, and how much has been staked. As a result, each participant has a chance of getting the full reward, and the likelihood increases in proportion to the amount they have staked.
